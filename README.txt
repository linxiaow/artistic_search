1. When ALL is hit, clear all the filters
2. I add a drop-down menu which can be used for sorting
    2.1 price option: sort the items from lowest price to highest
    2.2 collection Name: group by collection Name
    2.3 type: group by type
    2.4 reset: unsort the items
3. add number of result filtered
Comment: I used v-bind:key but there might be sometimes the description and information togle doesn't work. It is OK for my computer but sometimes CAEN will fail.
